### Training feedback

> One of the best, most useful workshops I have ever had, seriously! I think there are so many folks like me who kind of were thrown into it and didn't get a great basic foundation. Basic is good, and the trainer presented it so clearly and with purpose. Thanks for the training!!! _– Hemal Bavishi, Principal Architect, AVIN Systems_

> It was an excellent hands-on workshop. It helped in kickstarting my development activities. The trainer presented with great clarity and focus. Thanks for the training _– Shashwat Anand, Majesco – Mastek_

# Training feedback

One of the best, most useful workshops I’ve ever had, seriously! I think there are so many folks like me who kind of were thrown into it and didn’t get a great basic foundation. Basic is good, and the trainer presented it so clearly and with purpose. Thanks for the training!!!

It was a great experience and I learned a lot about the eclipse and its plug-in development capabilities. The workshop was full of knowledge and hands-on experience was quite impressive.

The workshop was really good. It was helpful and we could relate much of it to our project requirements. The trainer also gave us direction and a lot of RCP tips.

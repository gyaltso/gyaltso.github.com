### Training feedback

> One of the best, most useful workshops I’ve ever had, seriously! I think there are so many folks like me who kind of were thrown into it and didn’t get a great basic > foundation. Basic is good, and the trainer presented it so clearly and with purpose. Thanks for the training!!!
